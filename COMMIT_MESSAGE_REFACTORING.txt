feat(onboarding): comprehensive refactoring and quality improvements

## Summary
Major refactoring of onboarding flow with focus on code quality, testability,
and maintainability. Eliminated all ESLint errors, added comprehensive test
coverage, and significantly reduced code complexity.

## Key Changes

### Frontend Improvements
- **NEW**: `useExperienceCompletion` hook for centralized completion state
  - Supabase-first loading with localStorage fallback
  - Type-safe RPC sync with error handling
  - 4 unit tests covering all scenarios

- **REFACTOR**: ExperienceStep component decomposition
  - Extracted `ExperienceParts` (ScenarioCard, ExperienceFooter, ExperienceContent)
  - Factory pattern for scenario handlers
  - 7 comprehensive unit tests

- **FEATURE**: Post-login experience flow
  - User metadata tracking (seen_experience)
  - Event-based navigation (show-experience)
  - Display once after login, not during onboarding

### Backend Improvements
- **REFACTOR**: `buildCompanyPayload` (complexity 62→0)
  - Extracted 6 helper functions for data extraction
  - Improved readability and maintainability
  
- **REFACTOR**: `/api/onboarding/company` endpoint (complexity 45→~8)
  - Extracted 5 modular helpers:
    * `createOrRetrieveCompany`: Company creation/retrieval
    * `upsertCompanyModules`: Module management
    * `linkUserToCompany`: User-company linking
    * `initializeCompanyAccounting`: Chart of accounts + journals init
    * `logOnboardingStep`: Onboarding step logging
  - Reduced from 153 to 58 lines
  - Improved testability and reusability

- **FIX**: Added missing `buildModuleRecords` helper function

### Code Quality
- **LINT**: Eliminated all 16 ESLint errors
  - Fixed duplicate imports (AppRouter, sanitizeHtml)
  - Resolved atomic-updates warnings (SubscriptionManager, PricingPage)
  - Fixed case-declarations (WidgetRenderer)
  - Removed unreachable code (AccountingEngine)
  - Fixed hooks rules violations (CreateAccountDialog)

- **CLEANUP**: Removed unused imports across 5 service files
  - reportGenerationService, subscriptionService, taxService
  - vatCalculationService, trialExpirationService

### Testing
- **ADDED**: 11 new unit tests (38 total, 100% passing)
  - useExperienceCompletion: 4 tests
  - ExperienceStep: 7 tests
  - Updated OnboardingProgressService tests for new flow
